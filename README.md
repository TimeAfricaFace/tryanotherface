# TAF – Try Another Face 🌍🔥💧🌬️🌱

**Awaken the World. Awaken Yourself.**

TAF (Try Another Face) is more than an app — it’s a global awakening platform.  
Our mission is to create a **digital village** where people can remember who they truly are beyond systems of control, illusion, and distraction.  

## ✨ Vision
Humanity is connected, but still lost. People scroll endlessly, searching for meaning. TAF is built to help us stop performing, start awakening, and reconnect with our true essence — fire, water, air, and earth.  

## 🌍 What We’re Building
- **Global User Registration & Verification** – secure and inclusive onboarding.  
- **Awakening Feed** – share truths, experiences, and elemental expressions.  
- **Marketplace & Housing** – digital spaces for sustainable growth and exchange.  
- **Community Tools** – connect, collaborate, and support one another.  

## 🚀 Status
This is the beginning of TAF’s journey.  
Our current focus: **MVP development + community landing site** deployed via Netlify.  

## 🔮 Mission
> To awaken the world — not just from sleep, but from illusion, time, distraction, and the lies of men.  
> TAF is a call to humanity: *Try Another Face. Remember who you are.*
